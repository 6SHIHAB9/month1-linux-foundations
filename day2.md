#Day 2 — Linux Fundamentals
###Commands learned:

history: shows previously executed commands

clear: clears the terminal screen

expr: evaluates expressions (math, string length, etc.)

head: displays the first few lines of a file

tail: displays the last few lines of a file

less: lets you scroll through a file one page at a time

Variables: store values in shell and print them using echo $VARNAME

###Key lessons:

Variables in Linux are temporary containers for data (e.g., NAME=Shihab)

expr allows arithmetic directly in shell

head/tail are super handy for peeking into log files without opening them fully

less makes reading huge files manageable — it doesn’t load the whole file, just pages it in

history helps repeat or audit past commands (combine with !<number> to re-run)
